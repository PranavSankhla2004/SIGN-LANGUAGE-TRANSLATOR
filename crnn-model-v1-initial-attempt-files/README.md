## Word Level Indian Sign Language Recognition 

1. Sign language is used by members of deaf community to communicate .Each hand gestures in the language corresponds to a meaning.
2. In India there are over 5-million deaf people but there are only 250 certified interpreters which is one Interpreter for every 20000 deaf-people .
3. It is a practically impossible to balance this ratio between Interpreters and Deaf people ,this is where our project comes into action.
4. We propose  "Word Level Sign language Recognizer " for Indian Sign language by using  INCLUDE Dataset which  contains 2-3 second videos with the sign mentioned. 
5. This can prove as a Game-Changer for deaf community people to interact with other people 
6. First we are planning to extract key pose features points (body-positions ) and then we feed these videos in to Neural network architecture to find the spatial differences      between the frames, with that we think we can build an model to classify the signs to words .
